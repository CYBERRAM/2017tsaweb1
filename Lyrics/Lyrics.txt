<h2><center>Sugar, We're Goin Down</center></h2>
 
<p><center>
 Am I more than you bargained for yet?
Iíve been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
Cause thatís just who I am this week
Lie in the grass next to the mausoleum
Iím just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song
(A notch in your bedpost,
But you're just a line in a song)
</center></p>

<p><center>
Drop a heart, break a name
Weíre always sleeping in, sleeping for the wrong team
</center></p>

<p><center>
Weíre going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, weíre going down swinging
Iíll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
</center></p>


<p><center>
Weíre going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
Iíll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
</center></p>


<p><center>
Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching you two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isnít it messed up how Iím just dying to be him?
Iím just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song
(A notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song)
</center></p>

<p><center>
Drop a heart, break a name
Weíre always sleeping in, sleeping for the wrong team
</center></p>


<p><center>
Weíre going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, weíre going down swinging
Iíll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
</center></p>


<p><center>
Weíre going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, weíre going down swinging

<p><center>
Weíre going down, down (down, down)
Down, down (down, down)
Weíre going down, down (down, down)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
</center></p>

<p><center>
Weíre going down, down in an earlier round

<h2><center>Thanks fr th Mmrs</center></h2>


<p><center>
I'm gonna make you bend and break (It sent you to me without wait)
Say a prayer, but let the good times roll
In case God doesn't show (Let the good times roll, let the good times roll)
</center></p>

<p><center>
And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
Who does he think he is?
If that's the worst you got, better put your fingers back to the key
</center></p>

<p><center>
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories even though they weren't so great
He tastes like you, only sweeter
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
See, he tastes like you, only sweeter, oh
</center></p>

<p><center>
Been looking forward to the future
But my eyesight is going bad
In these crystal balls
It's always cloudy except for
When you look into the past
One night stand
(One night stand)
</center></p>

<p><center>
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories even though they weren't so great
He tastes like you, only sweeter
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
See, he tastes like you, only sweeter, oh
</center></p>

<p><center>
I only think in the form of crunching numbers
In hotel rooms, collecting page six lovers
Get me out of my mind
Get you out of those clothes
I'm a liner away
From getting you into the mood
Whoa
</center></p>

<p><center>
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories even though they weren't so great
He tastes like you, only sweeter
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
See, he tastes like you, only sweeter, oh
</center></p>

Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories

See, he tastes like you, only sweeter

<h2><center>My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark(Light Em Up)</center></h2> 

<p><center>
Ooh oh oh oh, ooh oh oh oh
Be careful making wishes in the dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the meantime I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out of the cage
I'm a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite
My songs know what you did in the dark
</center></p>


<p><center>
So light em up up up, light em up up up,
light em up up up, I'm on fire
So light em up up up, light em up up up,
light em up up up, I'm on fire
</center></p>


<p><center>
Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)
Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)
All the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just dies
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love
Then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides
My childhood spat back the monster that you see
My songs know what you did in the dark
</center></p> 


<p><center>
So light em up up up, light em up up up,
light em up up up, I'm on fire
So light em up up up, light em up up up,
light em up up up, I'm on fire
</center></p>


<p><center>
Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)
Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)
</center></p> 


<p><center>
My songs know what you did in the dark
My songs know what you did in the dark
</center></p>


<p><center>
So light em up up up, light em up up up,
light em up up up, I'm on fire
So light em up up up, light em up up up,
light em up up up, I'm on fire
</center></p>

Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)
Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)
Ooh oh oh

<h2><center>Centuries</center></h2> 

<p><center>
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
Just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
</center></p>


<p><center>Remember me for centuries</center></p>

Mama, fight my teenage dreams
No, it's nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong the story's aloof
Heavy metal, rock my heart
Come on, come on and let me in
I'm cruising on your thighs, leave my fingerprints
And this is for tonight
I thought that you would feel
I never meant for you to fix yourself
</center></p> 


<p><center>Remember me for centuries</center></p> 


<p><center>
And I can't stop till the whole word knows my name
'Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there is a light
My shadow is over you 'cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon
</center></p> 


<p><center>
He's been here forever
And he's the chosen fruit
I could scream forever
We all poisoned you
</center></p> 


<p><center>
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
Just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries

<h2><center><b>Immortals</b></center></h2>

They say we are what we are,
But we don't have to be,
I'm bad behavior but I do it in the best way,
I'll be the watcher (watcher) of the eternal flame,
I'll be the guard dog of all your favorite dreams
</center></p>

<p><center>
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass (glass, glass)
(Ooh)
I try to picture me without you but I can't
</center></p>


<p><center>
'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long,
And live with me forever now,
You pull the blackout curtains down,
Just not for long, for long,
We could be immor- immortals,
Immor- immortals,
Immor- immortals,
Immor- immortals,
</center></p>

<p><center>
Sometimes the only pay off for having any faith,
Is when it's tested again and again everyday,
I'm still comparing your past to my future,
It might be your wound but they're my sutures,
(Ooh)
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass (glass, glass)
(Ooh)
I try to picture me without you but I can't
